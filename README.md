🌍 Disaster Response AI

AI-Driven Disaster Analysis & Decision Support System

Disaster Response AI is an intelligent system designed to analyze disaster-related data and assist in rapid, data-driven decision making. The project leverages machine learning, data analysis, and visualization techniques to support emergency response planning and risk assessment for natural disasters.

🚀 Project Overview

Natural disasters require fast, accurate insights to minimize damage and save lives. This project focuses on analyzing historical disaster data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can support authorities, researchers, and disaster management teams in making informed decisions.

The system processes raw disaster datasets, performs exploratory data analysis, and lays the foundation for predictive and AI-driven disaster response solutions.
